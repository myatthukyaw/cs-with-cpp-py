# Stacks

### C++:

You can use the std::stack container from the STL for a simple and efficient stack implementation.
Alternatively, you can also implement a stack manually using arrays or linked lists.

### Python:

Lists can be used as stacks, but collections.deque is a more efficient alternative, especially when dealing with larger stacks due to its O(1) complexity for appends and pops from both ends.
